### Option 2 

#### Research question:

# "Oral and written questions allow Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons to query the government and its ministers on their work 
# (see [here](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/)). 
# What, if any, characteristics and factors discriminate MPs who tend to ask questions about economic issues from MPs
# who tend to ask questions about health and welfare issues?"

# Factors/ Characteristics of Discrimination:

# Party
# Length of Answer
# Gender
# Seniority
# Expertise
# Constituency Demographics
# Declaration of Members' Interests
# questionStatus
# number of words in answer


# Named day questions only occur in the House of Commons. 
# The MP tabling the question specifies the date on which they should receive an answer.
# MPs may not table more than five named day questions on a single day.


#### Required data source:

# [UK Parliament API](https://developer.parliament.uk/)


#### Getting to know the data: #####

## API Directory ##

# Some of the following Parliamentary APIs are versioned. Versioned APIs can be distinguished from others by the "/api/v{x}" portion of the URL, 
# x being the version number. A version of an API endpoint can have parts of its inputs or outputs extended, but not removed or modified. 
# If an endpoint requires input or output modifications or removal, this would result in a new version.

### Premiership of Theresa May ###
## 13 July 2016 â€“ 24 July 2019 ##

# I am using data from 11/2017 to 08/2019 for several reasons:
# firstly it only includes on cabinet with theresa may as prime minister which means that the data is not skewed by different governments and their different ideological positions
# secondly, I deliberately do not include data during covide
# thirdly, by having data from 21 months I am able to compare different times of the year


library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)

# I will offer several identification strategies:

#1st: classifying data by answering body
#2nd: classifying data by topic using dictionary and gsub?



### Written Questions with Answers ####

written_questions_url <- "https://questions-statements-api.parliament.uk/api/writtenquestions/questions"
written_questions <- fromJSON(written_questions_url)

# Creating a loop that takes the first 100 entries of each months in the years 2017 to 2020
# I deliberately exclude the covid years as the unusual amount of attention on the health policies does not allow for an accurate description of the data
